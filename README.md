# Poznan

This is the repository for the Poznan chapter of Papers We Love (https://paperswelove.org). As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/poznan/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

During the meetings, a speaker presents one computer science paper. The presentation is followed by a discussion with the attendees about the concepts described in the paper and their practical usage in our daily work.

Attendees are encouraged, but not required, to read the paper before the meeting.
